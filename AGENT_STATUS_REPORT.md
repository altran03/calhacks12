# 🤖 Agent Communication Status Report

## ✅ **What's Been Fixed**

### **1. Agent Registry System** ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Created `agents/agent_registry.py` - Central address book
- ✅ Created `AgentNames` constants for consistency  
- ✅ Created `get_agent_address()` helper function
- ✅ Updated `agents/__init__.py` to auto-register all agents
- ✅ All 9 agents registered on import with real Fetch.ai addresses

**Result:** Agents can now discover each other's addresses programmatically!

```python
# Before (BROKEN):
await ctx.send("coordinator_agent_address", message)  # ❌ Placeholder string

# After (WORKS):
await ctx.send(get_agent_address(AgentNames.COORDINATOR), message)  # ✅ Real Fetch.ai address
```

## 🔄 **What's In Progress**

### **2. Updating Agent Communication** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Parser Agent - Updated (2 hardcoded addresses fixed)
- 🔄 Eligibility Agent - Needs update
- 🔄 Shelter Agent - Needs update  
- 🔄 Resource Agent - Needs update
- 🔄 Transport Agent - Needs update
- 🔄 Social Worker Agent - Needs major refactor
- 🔄 Pharmacy Agent - Needs update + hospital inventory
- ✅ Coordinator Agent - Partially updated
- ✅ Analytics Agent - Already using correct pattern

---

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Remaining**

### **Issue #1: Hardcoded Addresses** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** Many agents still send to string literals like `"coordinator_agent_address"`

**Affected Agents:**
- Eligibility Agent (2 places)
- Shelter Agent (3 places)
- Resource Agent (2 places)
- Transport Agent (2 places)
- Social Worker Agent (2 places)
- Pharmacy Agent (2 places)

**Fix:** Add `from .agent_registry import get_agent_address, AgentNames` and replace all hardcoded strings

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes (find/replace in each file)

---

### **Issue #2: Workflow Doesn't Match MD File** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Current Flow:**
```
Coordinator → All Agents → Coordinator
```

**Required Flow (from CORRECT_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md):**
```
Coordinator → Pharmacy + Social Worker
Social Worker (REVIEWS) → Triggers Eligibility + Resource + Shelter (PARALLEL)
Shelter → Resource (sends address)
Shelter → Transport (schedules ride)
ALL → Social Worker (final verification)
Social Worker → Generates LaTeX PDF report
```

**What's Missing:**
1. Social Worker approval step after form review
2. Social Worker triggering 3 agents in parallel
3. Shelter-to-Resource communication
4. Shelter-to-Transport communication  
5. All agents reporting back to Social Worker (not Coordinator)
6. Social Worker final verification
7. Social Worker LaTeX report generation

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours to refactor

---

### **Issue #3: Pharmacy Agent Not Using Hospital Inventory** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current:** Queries external pharmacies via Bright Data  
**Required:** Reads `/backend/hospital_pharmacy_inventory.json`

**File exists:** ✅ Yes  
**Agent updated:** ❌ No

**Fix:**
1. Import `json`
2. Read `/backend/hospital_pharmacy_inventory.json`
3. Check hospital stock for discharge medications
4. Prepare 30-day supply

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

### **Issue #4: No MapBox Visualization Trigger** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current:** Transport Agent doesn't send MapBox data  
**Required:** Send `MapBoxVisualizationTrigger` message

**What's Missing:**
```python
await ctx.send(
    get_agent_address(AgentNames.SOCIAL_WORKER),
    MapBoxVisualizationTrigger(
        case_id=case_id,
        pickup_location={"name": "UCSF", "coordinates": [lat, lon]},
        dropoff_location={"name": "Harbor Light", "coordinates": [lat, lon]},
        route={...},
        eta_minutes=45
    )
)
```

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

---

### **Issue #5: No LaTeX Report Generation** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Current:** No final report  
**Required:** Social Worker generates comprehensive LaTeX PDF

**What's Missing:**
1. LaTeX template file
2. Social Worker report generation logic
3. PDF compilation using `subprocess` + `pdflatex`
4. Return PDF to frontend

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Priority 1: Fix Agent Addresses (QUICK WIN)**
This is the fastest and most critical fix. Without this, agents can't communicate at all.

**Action Items:**
1. Add imports to all agent files
2. Find/replace hardcoded addresses
3. Test agent registration on import

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Enables all agent communication

### **Priority 2: Pharmacy Agent Hospital Inventory**
This is a standalone feature that doesn't depend on other changes.

**Action Items:**
1. Read `hospital_pharmacy_inventory.json`
2. Check stock for medications
3. Prepare 30-day discharge supply

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** 🟡 HIGH - Matches your workflow requirements

### **Priority 3: Social Worker Refactor**
This is the big one - makes Social Worker the central hub.

**Action Items:**
1. Add approval message handler
2. Add parallel agent triggering
3. Add final verification logic
4. Add LaTeX report generation

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Core workflow requirement

## ✅ **What's Working Now**

1. ✅ Agents are properly initialized with Fetch.ai framework
2. ✅ Agents use `Protocol` objects correctly
3. ✅ Agents use `@protocol.on_message` decorators
4. ✅ Agents have `mailbox=True` for Agentverse deployment
5. ✅ Agent registry system is in place
6. ✅ Parser Agent partially fixed
7. ✅ Supabase database integration complete
8. ✅ MapBox displays real shelter coordinates

---

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Start with Priority 1 (15 minutes)** - Fix all agent addresses immediately.  
This is a quick win that enables all agent communication.

Then tackle **Priority 2 (30 minutes)** - Update Pharmacy Agent.  
This is standalone and gives you a complete feature.

Finally, work on **Priority 3 (2-3 hours)** - Social Worker refactor.  
This is the most complex but makes everything work together correctly.

**Total Time for Core Functionality:** ~3-4 hours

Would you like me to proceed with these fixes? I can:
1. ✅ Fix all agent addresses (15 min) ← **DO THIS FIRST**
2. ✅ Update Pharmacy Agent (30 min)
3. ✅ Refactor Social Worker as central hub (2-3 hours)
4. ✅ Add LaTeX report generation (1-2 hours)

Let me know if you want me to continue! 🚀
